# Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview

Welcome to the **Wine Quality Prediction** project! This Jupyter Notebook-based project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts the quality of wine based on various features. We'll employ a **Linear Regression** algorithm for this task.

This project is designed to be simple, yet educational, making it a great starting point for those interested in machine learning, regression analysis, or wine quality assessment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd wine-quality-prediction
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to understand the code, load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the Linear Regression model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes related to wine quality, such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, and more. The goal is to predict the wine quality, which is a numerical value between 0 and 10.

You can replace this dataset with your own wine dataset if needed. Just ensure that it has similar features and a quality column.

## Model

In this project, we utilize a **Linear Regression** model. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm for predicting a numerical value (in this case, wine quality) based on one or more input features. The model aims to find a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

## Results

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts wine quality.
